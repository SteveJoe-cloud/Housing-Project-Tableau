# House Sales Visualization

#### Overview
This project uses Tableau to create a stunning visualization of the Seattle housing market. The project follows the entire data analysis process, from data cleaning and modeling to dashboard creation and storytelling. The main goals of this project are:

- To show proficiency in using Tableau for complex data analysis and visualization tasks
- To deliver insights and recommendations for different stakeholders, such as home buyers, real estate agents, and policy makers
- To communicate the data stories in a creative and engaging way

#### Tasks
- **Task 1 - Data Preparation**: The raw housing sales data was cleaned and prepared for analysis, ensuring accuracy and consistency. The data was imported into Tableau and transformed into a suitable format for further analysis.
- **Task 2 - Data Modeling**: Various models were created to analyze different aspects of the housing market, such as price trends, geographical distribution, and property characteristics. The models were based on descriptive and inferential statistics, as well as spatial and temporal analysis.
- **Task 3 - Data Analysis & Visualization**: The models were used to create interactive visualizations that offer valuable insights into the housing market. The visualizations include filters, line charts, bar graphs, maps, and heatmaps. The visualizations highlight the key findings and patterns in the data, such as the daily average house sales prices, the distribution of house prices, and the relationship between views and condition ratings.
- **Task 4 - Dashboard Presentation & Storytelling**: The visualizations were integrated into an interactive dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of the housing market in Seattle. The dashboard is designed to ensure a user-friendly experience and effective communication. The dashboard also features a story mode that guides the user through the main insights and recommendations derived from the data.
